This project implements a Deep Learning pipeline for segmenting Red Blood Cells (RBC) from blood smear images to assist in the diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA). It features a hybrid architecture:
1.  **Python (TensorFlow/Keras):** Used for training the U-Net++ model and exporting it to ONNX.
2.  **C++ (OpenCV DNN):** A lightweight inference engine designed for deployment on embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or Windows via MSYS2.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment (Training and Export)**

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
**Critical**: You must use ```numpy<2.0``` to avoid compatibility issues with ```tf2onnx```.

```
pip install tensorflow tf2onnx "numpy<2.0" opencv-python
```

**2. C++ Environment (Windows MSYS2)**

This project relies on MSYS2 UCRT64 for a unified toolchain (GCC + OpenCV + Protobuf).

Open your MSYS2 UCRT64 terminal and install the dependencies:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-opencv
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-protobuf
```

## 🚀 Usage Guide
### Step 1: Train and Export Model (Python)

Run the Python script to build the U-Net++ architecture and export the trained model to ONNX format.

```
python unet_plus_plus_rbc.py
```
*Output*: This will generate unet_plusplus_rbc.onnx in your project root.

### Step 2: Compile C++ Inference Engine

We use CMake to build the C++ application. Ensure you are using the MinGW generator.

1. Create a build directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Configure CMake (Point to your MSYS2 library path if needed):
```
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DOpenCV_DIR="D:/msys64/ucrt64/lib/cmake/opencv4" ..
```

3. Compile:
```
mingw32-make
```

### Step 3: Run Inference

Before running, ensure unet_plusplus_rbc.onnx and sample_blood_smear.jpg are present in the build/ directory (or copy them there).

## ⚠️ Technical Notes

* Data Layout: The ONNX model is exported in TensorFlow's standard NHWC format (Batch, Height, Width, Channels).
* C++ Preprocessing: The C++ script manually constructs the input tensor to match the NHWC format. Standard cv::dnn::blobFromImage is avoided because it forces NCHW layout, which causes channel mismatch errors with Keras-exported models.
